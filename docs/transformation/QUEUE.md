# QUEUE — PW-MOBILE-TRANSFORM-01

Single source of truth for what remains. An item is written here **before** it starts, so a
mid-item crash leaves an accurate record. No item is queued without written acceptance criteria.

Status: `todo` · `in_progress` · `done` · `requeued` · `blocked` · `halted`

---

## Phase −1 — Safety preconditions (BLOCKS EVERYTHING)

### T-000 — Scaffold run state · `done`
owner: Orchestrator (Opus 5) · mode: default · file_boundary: `docs/transformation/**`
- [x] `DECISIONS.md` with run-start adjudications D-001…D-004
- [x] `HALTS.md`, `LEDGER.md`, `QUEUE.md`, `PROGRESS.md`
- [x] `lib/gap-detection.ts` hash recorded as phase-boundary baseline

### T-001 — Outbound dispatch stub · `done`
owner: Orchestrator (Opus 5) · mode: accept-edits · blocked_by: none
file_boundary: `lib/outbound/**`, `lib/email/email-service.ts`, `lib/push/web-push.ts`,
`lib/services/push.service.ts`, `tests/unit/outbound-dispatch-stub.test.ts`

Acceptance criteria:
- [x] Dispatch decided by ENVIRONMENT, never by credential presence, at every transport
- [x] Test run **throws** on a dispatch attempt; development skips and logs; production sends
- [x] Guard enumerates transports from the filesystem rather than a hardcoded list
- [x] Guard demonstrated failing first, both halves, revert proven green
- [x] `tsc --noEmit` clean

Review (Adversarial, Opus 5): **PASS.** The enumeration half found a third transport
(`lib/services/push.service.ts`, FCM) that the behaviour half would have missed — the
"fixed here, broke there" class caught inside the item that created it. Defect removed at all
three chokepoints, not relocated.

Failure proofs recorded in `PROGRESS.md`.

## Phase 0 — Evidence (no product code)

### T-010 — Enumerate every B2C surface · `done`
owner: Mechanical sweep (Haiku 4.5) · file_boundary: `docs/transformation/SURFACES.md`
`app/(protected)/` mixes B2C, agent and admin routes, so classification is the work.
- [ ] Every route file, dynamic segment, route group, parallel/intercepted route
- [ ] Every modal, sheet, drawer and overlay carrying content to read or act on
- [ ] Per surface: path, component-tree root, landing vs subpage, tier gating, reaching states
- [ ] Cross-check against the running app: routes unreachable in code, destinations that 404

### T-011 — Consolidate the harness · `in_progress`
owner: Evidence (Sonnet 5) · file_boundary: `tests/measure/**`
- [ ] `policy-detail.ts` → `metrics.ts`; update importers; no behaviour change
- [ ] Reconcile `clippedContent` / `clippedLabels` into ONE truncation definition (D-003)
- [ ] Re-run an existing baseline and prove numbers are byte-identical to `data/current/`

### T-012 — Extend the fixture matrix with missing degraded conditions · `todo`
owner: Evidence (Sonnet 5) · blocked_by: T-011 · file_boundary: `tests/measure/fixtures.ts`
Existing set already covers empty/single/typical/heavy/all-expired/pro-tier + 3 degraded.
Missing, per §5.3 — each must be able to PRODUCE its defect:
- [ ] English summary with no language tag · unauthored gap slug · extractor placeholder in an
      identity field · completed-then-failed run · channel-duplicated notifications (keyed AND
      unkeyed, per D-002) · out-of-map enum · policy with no premium · policy with no documents
- [ ] Longest real Greek strings from the string inventory

### T-013 — Outbound-copy inventory · `todo`
owner: Evidence (Sonnet 5) · blocked_by: T-001 · file_boundary: `docs/transformation/evidence/outbound/**`
Highest-exposure surface in the run and invisible from the UI.
- [ ] Every email and push template rendered TO TEXT via render functions, never the transport
- [ ] Per template: trigger, channels, and whether it renders a score, an unvalidated severity,
      an internal token, or English
- [ ] Leakage + locale-purity metrics run against the rendered output
- [ ] Confirm/refute the four known score sites (`templates.ts:57`, `weekly-digest.ts:118`,
      `engagement-drip.ts:115`, `churn-prevention.ts:91`)

### T-014 — Re-verify every candidate defect against HEAD · `todo`
owner: Orchestrator (Opus 5) · blocked_by: T-010
Per D-004 the contract's evidence is partly stale. Record reproduces / does not reproduce /
reproduces differently, with width, state, tier, root cause file:line, and fixture-vs-code-confirmed.

### T-015 — Baseline every surface · `todo`
owner: Evidence (Sonnet 5) · blocked_by: T-011, T-012
§4.5 order: Ειδοποιήσεις → Αρχική → Πορτοφόλι → Ασφαλιστήριο → Αναλύσεις AI → Σύμβουλος →
Ρυθμίσεις +5 subpages → app shell → upload flow → modals.
- [ ] Every metric, 320/390/430, every applicable state, published to `evidence/<surface>/BASELINE.md`

### T-016 — `LEDGER.md`, Greek string inventory, instrumentation plan, chrome audit · `todo`
owner: mixed · blocked_by: T-010
