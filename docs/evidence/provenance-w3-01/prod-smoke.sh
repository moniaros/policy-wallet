# Anonymous production smoke for PW-PROVENANCE-01 W3-01 (needs against cover, provenance on both sides).
# The item adds one comparison to the protection bundle and one block to the signed-in area detail; no route,
# schema, rule or row changes. An anonymous smoke proves the deploy carrying the item is live and the public
# product unchanged; the block itself is signed-in only and renders as a question on every live wallet until a
# life policy is re-analysed with confirmed citations (no production row carries `verified` yet).
# Re-runnable; writes nothing.
